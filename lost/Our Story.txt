	I, Clark Weckmann, am a web developer in training. I love all of my animals (Tarantual, 3 turtles, a cat, 2 dogs, 2 goats, a pacman frog, and I'm always getting more.) My animals are my babies. So if you could please take care of my baby boy until I can come pick him up I would be forever in your debt. I love my Shel-Shel he's helped me get through a lot... Thank you for reading.
