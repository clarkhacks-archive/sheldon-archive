          <h1>Sheldon The Turtle</h1>
          <h3>Bio:</h3>
          <p>Sheldon is a curious little critter that is very sociable. Most people love him from the start. I adopted him on <strong>May 7th, 2016</strong>. Every since that day he&#39;s been my best friend. His favorite food is grapes and he loves tea every once and awhile. Everyone in my family adores Sheldon and spoils him!</p>

          <h3>Why the blog?</h3>
          <p>Well, I wanted something to do one day and here I am. My little buddy loves the attention and I love that so many people like him!</p>
          <hr>
          <h3>Where is he from originally?</h3>
          <p>I got Sheldon in Missouri. He was near a park out there and right away we clicked! I found him out in the road laying down soaking up some sun. Right away he seemed interested in me. His first action was to bite the banana piece I offered.</p>
          <hr>
          <h3>Does he have playmates?</h3>
          <p>Yes! He has lots! I plan showing them on the blog one day here soon.</p>
