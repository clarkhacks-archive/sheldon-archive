### What does this even mean?
Originally [SheldonTheTurtle](https://sheldontheturtle.com) was created using HTML, BootStrap, and LOTS of JavaScript to keep it all simple and organize.

Okay so I had a lot of a files that your device needed to download in order to see the page properly. Now that Jekyll (Blog Management Engine) it is very easy. Before I was having issues with psoting daily because it would take about an hour to do 2 posts. Now thanks to Jekyll I can do it all in under a few minutes.

### So what is Jekyll, exactly?
Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and our Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers for free.

### Thanks For Staying Loyal!
I know this is a TOTALLY different style but trust me it grows on you!
