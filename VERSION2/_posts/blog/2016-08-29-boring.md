### Sheldon had a pretty basic day.
He mosied around the house and got a bath. He also slept A LOT. I wonder if he's feeling okay. He just seems off but thats any boring day I guess! <!--more-->

### Ooooph!

__Morning:__

Sheldon woke me up to his little feet scraping on the floor. He doesn't mean to I think but then again evertime I wake up he stairs at me and stretches out until I pet him for a little.

__Day:__

Sheldon pretty much just slept and ate some snacks.

__Evening:__

He got a bath! He enjoyed going splish slash! I was amazed at how much dirt came off his rather shiney shell!

__Night:__

Sheldon is all curled up for bed. Sorry today's post wasn't that interesting!

~ Goodnight
