### Sheldon is going to bed.
Sheldon had lots of fun today! He had lots of yummy food, you can see what he ate at the meal section (on the side bar). <!--more-->

### Play time! 
Sheldon had lots of fun today playing with Sadie (his dog friend). They get along so well and she just loves watching him move around. Sadie watched him as he walked around the house and enjoy his meals. 

### Good night!!!
