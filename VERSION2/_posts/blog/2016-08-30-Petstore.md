### Sheldon at the pet store! 

(Sheldon POV) 

Today I slept like all day. Dad woke me up to get a bath and eat some food.  Right before I got In the bath uncle Mikey walked in the front door! So guess who got to skip bath time! MEE! 

#### Time with Uncle Mikey

We went to the pet store! I got to see some turtle friends and lots of dogs! I got to try on doggy clothes and look around. I got so much attention and it was so fun! 

#### Overall

Today was fun! I had lots of fun and got lots of sleep

Good night viewers!
