### Spoils For The Turtle
Sheldon's grandma (my mom) loves him. She plays with him and holds him and is always watching for him underfoot. He always get praise and fed a lot! She treats him like her actual grandchild and it's adorable.

### Food!

Sheldon will have chicken and dumplings while he's here and probably some grape or tomatoes and whatever else she feeds him. His grandma loves feeding him and watching him eat!
